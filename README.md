Family Parking

FamilyParking is an application dedicated for the family for families to broadcast the parking information of shared cars among family members. FamilyParking keeps track of the last position where the car is parked and helps family members to find it easily and quickly.  

All you need to do when you park the car is to push the parking button, and this position will be flaged so all the other members can reach the car position when needed. You need to push the button also when you move the car so the family will know that the car is not available now. 

If your car has an embedded Bluetooth, you don't need to push any button when you park the car or remove it in order to broadcast this information to the family, else the auto parking detection property of FamilyParking will understand automatically when you park the car or remove it and the rest of the process will be managed automatically. 

If you don't have the Bluetooth embedded in your car and you usually forget to broadcast the parking position among the family members manually,the clever Parky property of FamilyParking will remind you by sending a notification to you whenever it understands that you parked the car or moved it asking  for your confirmation. The notification system is clever enough not to bother you with a lot of notifications that are useless.
